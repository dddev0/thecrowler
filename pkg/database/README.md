# CROWler supported Database Managers

Although if I am working to add support for multiple database managers, the only
one supported at the moment is PostgreSQL. The database manager is used to store
the data collected by the CROWler. The database manager is also used to store
the sources etc. of the CROWler.

Work in progress to add support for other database managers:

- SQLite
- MySQL / MariaDB
